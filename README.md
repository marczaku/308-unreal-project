# 308 - Unreal Game Project

## Goal

Work on an Unreal Game Prototype. The goal of a prototype is to provide a Proof of Concept for whether a certain idea is technically achievable and/or fun and engaging. Focus on exploring the core mechanics of such a game. Make the prototype pretty only if you have enough time.

### Note: Examination Project

In this group project, you can lay yourselves a great foundation for the examination project which will be a 10-week-project in November-December and expected to yield you a final, great portfolio piece (and the last chance for a while to dedicate yourself full-time to a project that you develop for the fun for it and not to be profitable).

You will have a certain range of freedom for the examination project. But the range of freedom will definitely allow you to continue work on this prototype or to re-implement it "the right way".
